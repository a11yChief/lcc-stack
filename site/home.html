          <h2>Competitions </h2>
          <p>
            If you’re interested in competing, why not join one of our five teams? Each team caters to a different
            skill
            level. Team 5 is ideal for more casual players, or anyone looking to enter their first competition,
            whereas team
            1
            is reserved for our top players.
