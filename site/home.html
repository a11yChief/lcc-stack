    <h1>Welcome to Lytham Chess Club</h1>
    <p>
      We're glad you've found us. And no matter your skill level, we're happy to have you.
    </p>
    <h2>We believe chess is for everyone</h2>
    <p>
      No matter how seriously you take your chess, you're welcome here. Our players range from beginners to
      experts, and we're always happy to welcome new members, whether you want to play in competitions or just for fun.
    </p>
    <h2>Competitions </h2>
    <p>
      If you’re interested in competing, why not join one of our five teams? Each team caters to a different skill
      level. Team 5 is ideal for more casual players, or anyone looking to enter their first competition, whereas team 1
      is reserved for our elite masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have five teams which play in the Blackpool and Fylde Chess League. We also play in the Challenge Cup
      and the Rapidplay Cup. In addition to the Blackpool and Fylde competitions we also run club tournaments such as
      the
      Club Championship and the Summer Swiss. Members can also play in the Silver Queen tournament which is a blitz
      chess
      competition at the start of the season.

      If you would like to play please read the Join Us page for further details. We aim to be a friendly club and to
      treat players equally regardless of race, religion, disability, skin colour, political views, gender or sexual
      orientation.
