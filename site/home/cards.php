<h2>Competitions </h2>
<p>
              If youâ€™re interested in competing, why not join one of our five teams? Each team caters to a different
              skill
              level. Team 5 is ideal for more casual players, or anyone looking to enter their first competition, whereas team 1
              is reserved for our top players.
